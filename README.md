# Fare Evasion prediction system :chart_with_upwards_trend: :station:


## Description

The entire Berlin transportation system runs on the honor system. However, you need to show a ticket when fares are enforced via random spot-checks by inspectors. Of course, during these checks there are evaders detected. All this data is then collected via the handheld device used by the inspectors which will utilized for various data project.


This project will have the capability to predict the U-Bahn, S-Bahn, buses, and trams evasions according to the historical data taken from inspectors. With this system the users (inspectors) will be able to obtain the prediction and route to follow within the range of parameters given. Therefore, the inspectors will be available in the most prone zone of the city at the right frequency where is likely to have evaders.
